# Dynamic System and Chat Prompts

## User Story

### Goal 

- As a user, I want flexibility in which models I use, regardless of which format they use for instructions and structured data. 
- I want to use `SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF` with MCP tools, something the model page touts as a core feature. 
- I also want the ability to manage the bot's chain of thought process visibility, so it is not crowding the display or passed to the text-to-speech engine.

---

### Problem Statement

- But this requires me to: 
    - 1. stop the Chainlit container, 
    - 2. modify the application, 
    - 3. Restart Chainlit
    - 4. Test the edit I just made.
    ...Every single time I change the prompt, which could be dozens of times in an hour while I'm testing.
    - **This is a lot of time spent stopping, editing, restarting...**

- Complicating things further, the `<think>` and `</think>` tags are not being recognized as EOS strings, 
    - and thus they're being interpreted as Assistant -> User messages, 
    - and are passed to the text to speech engine. 
    - This results in a massive audio file being generated and playing audio that breaks immersion.


     SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF's reasoning is toggled by way of the "/think" and "/no_think" runtime commands, sent as a chainlit command in the UI. They can also be appended to the System prompt, which of course requires the ability to edit test, etc.


- The current prompting system is not flexible at all. 
    - Manual edits in `docker\chainloot\chainlit\lib\bot_config.py`
    - Prompts are not shareable amongst personas


- It should allow for dynamically updating the prompt at runtime, 
- without restarting the application. 
- Prompts should be 
    - templated, 
    - savable, 
    - searchable, 
    ... and more generally dynamic. 
---

- We have the datalayer, which includes Postgres and S3 (via LocalStack)
    - Design a system to dynamically load and save model and persona configuration parameters
    - Should support different chat standards
        - For MVP just these:
            - Whatever Smollm3 uses (Must)
            - Alpaca (Stretch goal)
            - ChatML (Stretch goal)

What design options makes the most sense?

## Happy Path:

#### Must support model:
- [ ] Smollm3-3b-128k-gguf: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF
    - [ ] 128k context enabled
    - [ ] Tools Supported
    - [ ] Reasoning Toggleable
- Must toggle support reasoning chain of thought from prompt, or from /command
    - [ ] toggle `<think>` / `/think`
    - [ ] toggle `</think>` / `/no_think`
        - [ ] Disables/Enables Reasoning when toggled (via command or UI widget)
        - [ ] Properly *updates* and *respects state* of the Reasoning toggle in the **Settings UI**
    - [ ] Contents of "Chain of Thought" message respect the settings in `config.toml`
            - **QUESTION: How does this work in chainlit's config.toml? Does full just mean the COT window is fully expanded? Or that it's just the full chain and has no specific bearing on the UI element?**
        - [ ] Full
        - [ ] Tool only
        - [ ] Hidden
            - Must not display this content expanded during chat
            - Must not be sent to text-to-speech
- [ ] Tool Usage works as expected
    - [ ] <tool> and </tool> wrapped messages are not treated as Assistant -> User messages, but rather are parsed as tool requests.
        - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_extras
        - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_response_parsing
        - https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/chat-templates
        - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/chat_templating
    - [ ] Not read as a message by the text-to-speech service
- [ ] Prompts can be dynamically:
    - [ ] Loaded
    - [ ] Saved
    - [ ] Edited
    - [ ] Deleted
    - [ ] Exported
    - [ ] Applied amongst any persona
        - [ ] MVP: Yoda must work
        - [ ] 3PO / AI
        - [ ] Stark
- [ ] Prompts support custom stop strings / EOS strings
- [ ] Must be able to tune chat settings (temperature, seed, etc)
  - See example prompt config templates:
    - [ ] docs\IN_PROGRESS_TASKS\prompt_catalog\examples\yoda_prompt_v42.toml
    - [ ] docs\IN_PROGRESS_TASKS\prompt_catalog\examples\code_assistant_v2.toml # Mught need to be updated to suppoprt official smolLM3 chat template, below
- [ ] Should be flexible to support chat templates from other standards, such as:
    - [ ] Alpaca
    - [ ] ChatML
        - https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating
- [ ] Must support jinja style chat templates in gguf models
    - https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/chat-templates

## Required Model

### Smollm3-3b-128k-gguf (from unsloth):
- Model Card: https://huggingface.co/unsloth/SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF
- `ollama run hf.co/unsloth/SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF:Q4_K_M` # This specific version has 128k context length, reasoning, tool use
- `docker model run hf.co/unsloth/SmolLM3-3B-128K-GGUF:Q4_K_M` # or DMR
- Uses Jinja chat template
    - "Includes our chat template fixes! Extended via YaRN. If you are using llama.cpp, use `--jinja` to enable the system prompt." (see below)
